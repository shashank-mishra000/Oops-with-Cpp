Beleive you can and  you are already halfway there.
Never Stop Learning Because Life Never Stops Teaching.
A Journey of 1000 miles begins with one step.
Be Brave and go on an adventure.
The Secret of getting ahead is getting started
the 5 second tule the moment you get an instinct to act on a goal you must 5-4-3-2-1 and physically move or your brain will stop you.
Little things make big days.
Imagine with all your mind believe witha all your heart achieve with all your might.
Never never ever giveup.
All things are difficult before they are easy.
The best way to make your dream come true is to wake up.
It always seems impossible until its done.
When you feel like quiting remember why you started.
Work hard in silence and let success make the noise.
You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.
Smile is the best outfit.
Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspirartion. (thomas alva edison)
